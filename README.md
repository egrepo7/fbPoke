# Poke Simulator

This was my first full stack web app built using Python in the Pylot framework. 

The project demonstrates the "poke" functionality of Facebook. 

The goal was to be able track of all user information as well as user poke interaction using mySQL database. Twitter bootstrap was used to do front-end related styling.
